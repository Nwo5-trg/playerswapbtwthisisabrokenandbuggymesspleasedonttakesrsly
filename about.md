# guide to getting around this scuffed mod and making it somewhat kinda work :3c

if timer doesnt show up just leave and rejoin the level until it does,=

loop time has to be synced across clients

every gamemode is in freemode

gravity is not saved, so for levels u should prolly have invisible constantly toggling portals for diff gravity sections

timer might be off between clinets but at most its like 1 second so its fine

:3c
